PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
___________________

Using Lab02 as a foundation, the goal of Lab 03 is to implement
a TCP like networking protocol using UDP as the underlying
transfer method. This is done by replacing all the TCP function
calls (send, recv, socket, bind) with the UDP calls (sendto, 
recvfrom, socket, and bind). Each of the files used are described
below.

====| ftps.c |===================================================

Largely untouched from Lab02, ftps.c contains the server code
for recieving the file to be transfered and writing it to a local
folder "recvd". The main changes were, as described above,
replacing the bind, socket, send, and recv with BIND, SOCKET,
SEND, and RECV which are user defined functions described in
srbaclib.c. Once started, ftps.c will request a certain number of
bytes from tcpds.

====| ftpc.c |===================================================

Largely untouched from Lab02, ftpc.c contains the client code for
sending a local file, across the network 
	(tcpdc -> Troll -> tcpds -> ftps)
where it will be written to a new file by ftps.c. Like ftps.c, 
the main changes involved changing the bind, socket, send and recv
with our user defined srbaclib.c functions BIND, SOCKET, SEND, and 
RECV. Once started with the proper parameters, ftpc.c will attempt
to send a file through the network to the given server socket.

====| srbaclib.c |================================================

New for Lab03 is our library file that contains the new methods
that are responsible for the creation of sockets and sending of 
packets. The following functions are described in srbaclib.c:
	SEND - Converts the TCP send() to the UDP sendto()
	RECV - Converts the TCP recv() to the UDP recvfrom()
	BIND - Identical to bind() but assigns dest_addr
	ACCEPT - No functionality for Lab03
	CONNECT - No functionality for Lab03
	SOCKET - Identical to socket()

====| srbaclib.h |================================================

Header file that contains the function definitions for srbaclib.c

====| tcpds.c |===================================================

Contains the methods for recieving data from the ftps.c server that
includes 
	1) The fact that the server is ready to recieve the file
	2) The size of the buffer it is expecting
It is responsible for recieving the packets from tcpdc.c and
forwarding them to ftps.c where it will construct the recieved file.

====| tcpdc.c |===================================================

Contains the methods for sending packets from ftpc.c to the Troll
which, acting like a network will forward them to the given address
which is the tcpds.c.

====| Makefile |==================================================

Contains the command line arguements for compiling and cleaning the
Lab03 files.

Running Instruction
___________________

To successfully execute a file transfer using Lab03, one must
complete the following steps. Note: cM = Client Machine 
									sM = Server Machine

1) Comple the code by executing:
	| $ make clean
	| $ make

2) Run tcpds and tcpdc by executing in multiple terminals/machines
	| sM$ tcpds
	| cM$ tcpdc <server-IP> <server-PORT>

3) Run troll by executing on the client machine
	| cM$ troll <local-PORT>

4) Run ftps by executing the following on the server machine
	| sM$ ftps <server-PORT>

5) Run ftpc by executing the following on the client machine
	| cM$ ftpc <server-IP> <server-PORT> <local-file-to-transfer>
